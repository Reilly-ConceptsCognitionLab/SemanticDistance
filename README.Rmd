## Before Starting
SemanticDistance nominally requires a dataframe with at least one column variable and one row of text. The package is capable of processing many more dataframe formats (e.g., word pairs arrayed in columns, conversation transcripts, unordered word lists). SemanticDistance will retain all of your original metadata after splitting/unlisting your text into a one-word-per-row structure. This sequential structure is ideal for joining distance values to timestamps and other variables as language unfolds (e.g., reaction time, pupil diameter).

## Install & Load
Install the development version of SemanticDistance from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using devtools.
```{r, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("Reilly-ConceptsCognitionLab/SemanticDistance")
library(SemanticDistance)
```

# <span style="color: darkred;">---Step 1: Cleaning--- </span>
The semantic distance functions work by indexing unique numeric identifiers. You MUST first clean/prep your raw text to append these identifers. Prepare your lexical data for computing pairwise semantic distances by first doing the following: <br/>

1) Read your data into R. Label your text and metadata columns however you like. <br/>
2) Your dataframe should contain at least one column with the target string data (e.g., mytext). <br/>
3) Identify the format of your sample (e.g., monologue, dialogue, columns, unstructured). <br/>
4) Decide on your cleaning parameters (lemmatize, omit stopwords, omit punctuation). <br/>
5) Run the approproate cleaning function specifying the parameters that best fit your data and aims. <br/>
<br/>

## <span style="color: brown;">1.1 Clean Monologue Transcript (clean_monologue)</span>
A monologue transcript consists of any ordered text sample NOT delineated by a talker/speaker (e.g., stories, narratives). Clean a monologue transcript by calling the 'clean_monologue' function. Specific arguments include: <br/>

| df =  raw dataframe with at least one column of text
| wordcol = quoted variable reflecting the column name where your target text lives (e.g., 'mytext')
| clean = applies cleaning functions (e.g., punct out, lowercase, etc); default is TRUE
| omit_stops = omits stopwords, default is TRUE
| lemmatize = transforms raw word to lemmatized form, default is TRUE

### Output of 'clean_monologue' on cleaning/prepping a raw monologue transcript</span>
```{r}
MyCleanMonologue <- clean_monologue(MonologueSample1, 'word', clean=T)
head(MyCleanMonologue, n=10)
```
<br/>

## <span style="color: brown;">1.4 Clean Dialogue Transcript (clean_dialogue)</span>
This could be a conversation transcript or any language sample where you care about talker/interlocutor information (e.g., computing semantic distance across turns in a conversation). Your dataframe should nominally contain a text column and a speaker/talker column. Arguments clean_dialogue are: <br/>
| df = your raw dataframe with at least one column of text AND a talker column
| wordcol = column name (quoted) containing the text you want cleaned
| whotalks = column name (quoted) containing the talker ID (will convert to factor)
| clean = T/F (default is T) applies cleaning functions
| omit_stops = T/F omits stopwords, default is TRUE
| lemmatize = T/F transforms raw word to lemmatized form, default is TRUE

### Output of 'clean_dialogue' prepping a dialogue transcript
```{r}
MyCleanDialogue <- clean_dialogue(DialogueSample1, "word", "speaker", omit_stops=T, lemmatize=T)
head(MyCleanDialogue, n=6)
```
<br/>

## <span style="color: brown;">1.2 Clean Word Pairs Arrayed in Columns (clean_2columns)</span>
SemanticDistance also computes pairwise distance for data arrayed in columns. Run the function, the cleaned columns will appear in the dataframe. Arguments to the 'clean_monologue' function call are: <br/>
| df = your raw dataframe with at least one column of text
| word1 = quoted variable reflecting the column name where your first word lives
| word2 = quoted variable reflecting the column name where your first word lives
| clean = T/F (default is T) applies cleaning functions
| omit_stops = T/F omits stopwords, default is TRUE
| lemmatize = T/F transforms raw word to lemmatized form, default is TRUE

### Output of 'clean_2columns' cleaning word pairs arrayed in columns
```{r}
MyClean2Columns <- clean_2cols(ColumnSample, 'word1', 'word2', clean=T, omit_stops=T, lemmatize=T)
head(MyClean2Columns, n=6) #view head cleaned data
```
<br/>
<br/>

## <span style="color: brown;">1.3 Clean Unordered Word List (clean_unordered4matrix)</span>
This cleaning option is used for prepping a vector of words for hierarchical clustering. Word order is no longer a factor since all words will be shuffled. This cleaning function retains only one instance of a word (no duplicates). Arguments to the 'clean_unordered4matrix' function call are: <br/>
| df = your raw dataframe with at least one column of text
| wordcol = quoted variable reflecting where your text lives
| clean = T/F (default is T) applies cleaning functions 
| omit_stops = T/F omits stopwords, default is TRUE 
| lemmatize = T/F transforms raw word to lemmatized form, default is TRUE

### Output of 'clean_unordered4matrix' on unordered word list </span>
```{r}
#Run clean fn 
MyCleanDat4Matrix <- clean_unordered4matrix(FakeCats, wordcol="word", clean=TRUE, omit_stops=TRUE, lemmatize=TRUE) 
head(MyCleanDat4Matrix, n=8)
```
<br/>
<br/>

# <span style="color: darkred;">---Step 2: Compute Semantic Distance---</span>
SemanticDistance will append cosine distance values between each pair of elements specified by the user (e.g., word-to-word, ngram-to-word). These distance values are derived from two large lookup databases in the package with fixed semantic vectors for >70k English words. CosDist_Glo reflects cosine distance between vectors derived from training a GLOVE word embedding model (300 hyperparameters per word). CodDist_SD15 refects cosine distance between two chunks (words, groups of words) characterized across 15 meaningful perceptual and affective dimensions (e.g., color, sound, valence). <br/>

Users specify an ngram window size. This window rolls successively over your language sample to compute a semantic distance value for each new word relative to the n-words (ngram size) before it. This model of compouting distance is illustrated in the figure. The larger your specified ngram size the more smoothed the semantic vector will be over your language sample. Once you settle on a window size and clean your language transcript (works for monologues only), you are ready to roll. Here's the general idea... <br>

## <span style="color: brown;">2.1: Compute Ngram-to-Word Distance (dist_ngram2word)</span>
Computes cosine distance for two models (embedding and experiential) using a rolling ngram approach consisting of groups of words (ngrams) to the next word.

<img src="man/figures/RollingNgramIllustrate.png" alt="illustrates how rolling ngrams work on a vector of words by moving a window and contrasting each chunk to each new word" width="40%" />

Remember to call a cleaned/prepped dataframe! Arguments to 'dist_ngram2word' are: <br/>
| dat dataframe of a monologue transcript cleaned and prepped with clean_monologue fn <br/>
| ngram ngram window size preceding each new content word <br/>

### Output of 'dist_ngram2word' ngram-to-word distance on monologue transcript
```{r}
MyNgram2WordDists <- dist_ngram2word(MyCleanMonologue, ngram=1) #distance word-to-word
head(MyNgram2WordDists, n=8)
```
<br/>

## <span style="color: brown;">2.2: Compute Ngram-to-Ngram Distance (dist_ngram2ngram)</span>
User specifies n-gram size (e.g., ngram=2). Distance computed from each two-word chunk to the next iterating all the way down the dataframe until there are no more words to 'fill out' the last ngram.  

<img src="man/figures/Ngram2Ngram_Dist.png" alt="illustrates how semantic distance is derived from chunk to chunk groupings of words" width="50%" />

Arguments to dist_ngram2ngram are: <br/>
| dat = dataframe w/ a monologue sample cleaned and prepped <br/>
| ngram = chunk size (chunk-to-chunk) <br/>

### Output of 'dist_ngram2ngram' ngram-to-ngram distance on monologue transcript
```{r}
#Give the function a cleaned monologue transcript
MyNgram2NgramDists <- dist_ngram2ngram(MyCleanMonologue, ngram=2)
head(MyNgram2NgramDists, n=8)
```
<br/>

## <span style="color: brown;">2.3: Compute Turn-by-Turn Distance (dist_dialogue_turns)</span>
Averages the semantic vectors for all content words in a turn. Computes the cosine distance to the average of the semantic vectors of the content words in the subsequent turn. <br/>

Arguments to 'dist_dialogue_turns' are: <br/>
| dat = dataframe w/ a dialogue sample cleaned and prepped using 'clean_dialogue' fn<br/>

### Output of 'dist_dialogue_turns' turn-to-turn distance on sample dialogue transcript </span>
```{r}
#MyDialogueDists <- dist_dialogue_turns(MyCleanDialogue)
#head(MyDialogueDists, n=15)
```
<br/>

## <span style="color: brown;">2.4: Compute Distances Between Word Pairs in Columns (dist_2cols)</span>
When your data are arrayed in two columns and you are interested in computing pairwise distance across the columns. The only critical argument is your dataframe name. Remember to pass a cleaned dataframe (even if you disable stopwords and lemmatization). Arguments to the function: <br/>
| dat = your cleaned dataframe with two paired columns of text <br/>

Arguments to 'dist_2cols' are: <br/>
| dat = dataframe w/ word pairs arrayed in columns cleaned and prepped using 'clean_2cols' fn<br/>

### Output of 'dist_2cols' on 2-column arrayed dataframe
```{r}
MyDistsColumns <- dist_2cols(MyClean2Columns) #only argument is dataframe
head(MyDistsColumns, n=8)
```
<br/>

## <span style="color: brown;">2.5: Compute Distance from a Fixed Cluster of Words in the Beginning of a Language Sample to each new word in the sample (anchor_dist)</span>
This approach models the semantic distance from each successive new word in a language sample to the average of the semantic vectors for the first block of 10 content words in that sample. This anchored distance provides a metric of overall semantic drift as a language sample unfolds relative to a fixed starting point.<br/>

Arguments to 'anchor_dist' are: <br/>
| dat = dataframe w/ a monologue sample cleaned and prepped using 'clean_monologue' fn<br/>
| anchor_size = size of the initial chunk of words for chunk-to-new-word comparisons fn<br/>

<img src="man/figures/Anchor_2Word_Dist.png" alt="illustrates distance from each new word of a language sample to an initial chunk of n-words" width="60%" />

### Output of 'anchor_dist' on a sample monologue transcript
```{r}
MyDistsAnchored <- dist_anchor(MyCleanMonologue, anchor_size=8)
head(MyDistsAnchored, n=10)
```
<br/>

### <span style="color: brown;">2.6: Compute Distance Matrix All Word Pairs (dist_matrix_all)</span>
Returns square matrix where each entry [i,j] is the cosine distance between word i and word j. Matrix contains original words as both row and column names for reference. User specifies whether to return a matrix based on embeddings (GLOVE) or experiential norms (SD15). Input a unordered vector of words cleaned/prepped with 'clean_unordered4matrix' function <br/>

Arguments to 'dist_matrix_all' are: <br/>
| dat = dataframe cleaned and prepped using 'clean_unordered4matrix' fn<br/>
| dist_type = quoted argument default is 'embedding', other option is "SD15" fn<br/>

### Output of 'dist_unordered' on unordered word list
```{r}
MyDistMatrix <- dist_matrix_all(MyCleanDat4Matrix)
head(MyDistMatrix)
```
<br/>
<br/>

# <span style="color: darkred;">---Step 3: Data Visualization Options---</span>
## Monologue Time Series: ngram2word
Plots id_orig (as x-axis time) by distance measure (facetted GLO and SD15). Add red line annotation if semantic distance jump is z>3 based on the distribution of that time series
```{r}
#Select id_orig, "CosDist_Glo", "CosDist_SD15", pivot_longer
#add smoothing options
#Argument annotate=T, adds red line whenever semantic distance jump is z>3
#linear interpolation using zoo, necessary for geom_path to complete
#pivots on any/all cos_dist columns
#facets on any/all cos_dist columns
#scale axis 0 to 1.5
```
