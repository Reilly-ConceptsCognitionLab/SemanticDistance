Description: This package cleans and formats any user-specified language sample and appends two metrics of semantic distance (experiential and embedding) to each specified chunk (e.g., word-to-word, ngram-to-ngram, turn-to-turn). 
     Users have several options for how to clean their data (e.g., leave it alone, lemmatize it, retain/omit stopwords). 
     Users also have options for how to chunk distances. Options include word-to-word distance, ngram-to-ngram, sentence-to-sentence, turn-to-turn.
